    I don't just play video games. I take time to study the game. I try to search for easter eggs, appreciate the extreme game details the developers gave us and eventually learn how to play the game the right way.

    <p>I used to play in <strong>Super Smash Bros. tournaments</strong>. There are currently four different Super Smash Bros. games, 64, Melee, Brawl and 4(chronologically ordered). The ones' I played in tournaments were Melee and 4.</p>

                        <strong>Villager</strong> is a character who uses traps and here is a video of me showing how to use his traps effectively. (Super Smash Bros. 4)</p>

                        Villager is also a character who can be really <strong>tricky</strong> and <strong>extra</strong>. To be able to play him without trouble you need to <strong>think out of the box</strong> and be <strong>creative</strong>. This video here is a proof of it. (Super Smash Bros. 4)</p>

                        The other character I also use is named <strong>Marth</strong>.
                        On this video you can clearly see that as a player you need to have <strong>patience</strong> as he does not have long ranged tools to aid him in battle.
                        You also need to be <strong>precise</strong> and <strong>well-timed</strong> to give the most damage because the tip of his sword gives the most damage from his attacks.(Super Smash Bros. 4)</p>
