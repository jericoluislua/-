        My name is <b>Jerico Luis Lua</b>. A <b>very energetic</b>, <b>creative</b>, <b>loyal</b> and <b>funny 18 year old young man from the Philippines</b> that has been <b>living in Switzerland for 6 years</b> now.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am currently in my <b>third</b> and <b>last year</b> as an <b>IT(application developer) student</b>. I go to <a href="https://www.bwdbern.ch/ims/" id="bwdlink" target="_blank">b(wd</a> 4 times a week and this is where I have my normal school subjects(German, Math, etc).
        On the other hand I go to <a href="https://gibb.ch/grundbildung/berufe/informatikerin" target="_blank" id="gibblink">gibb</a> to learn about my IT modules.
        All in all I go to three different schools. The third school I go to is <a href="https://berufsbildungscenter.ch/lehrberuf-informatik/" target="_blank" id="bbclink">Bbc</a>, where I learn about application developer specific modules.

            The very <b>first thing I learned</b> IT-wise was in my sixth grade in the Philippines and that was <b>HTML</b> with a tiny bit of <b>CSS</b>.
            <br>
            The rest is history in <b>gibb</b> and <b>Bbc</b>. I even learned more stuff about HTML and CSS in those schools. Most of my IT knowledge came from gibb and Bbc.
            <br>
            <br>
            From <b>Front-End languages</b> like <b>JavaScript</b>/<b>JQuery</b> to <b>Back-End languages</b> like <b>Java</b>, <b>Android(Java)</b>, <b>C#</b> and <b>php</b> but also <b>script languages</b> like <b>SQL</b>, <b>python</b> and <b>BASH</b>.
            <br>
            We didn't just learn how to program we also learned how to use programs to help us like for example <b>Github</b>. Where we can upload our projects and download the newest version that easily.
