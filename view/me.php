        My name is <strong>Jerico Luis Lua</strong>. A <strong>very energetic</strong>, <strong>creative</strong> and <strong>funny 20 year old young man from the Philippines</strong> that has been <strong>living in Switzerland for 8 years</strong> now.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was <strong>four</strong> years in <strong>IMS</strong> as an <strong>IT(application developer) student</strong>. I went to <a href="https://www.bwdbern.ch/ims/" id="bwdlink" target="_blank">b(wd</a> 4 times a week and this is where I had my normal school subjects(German, Math, etc).
        On the other hand I went to <a href="https://gibb.ch/grundbildung/berufe/informatikerin" target="_blank" id="gibblink">gibb</a> to learn more about IT.
        All in all I went to three different schools. The third school I went to is <a href="https://berufsbildungscenter.ch/lehrberuf-informatik/" target="_blank" id="bbclink">Bbc</a>, where I learned about application developer specific modules.
        Currently, I'm in CsBe finishing my IT lessons and hopefully get an internship afterward.

            The very <strong>first thing I learned</strong> IT-wise was in my sixth grade in the Philippines and that was <strong>HTML</strong> with a tiny bit of <strong>CSS</strong>.
            <br>
            The rest is history in <strong>gibb</strong> and <strong>Bbc</strong>. I even learned more stuff about HTML and CSS in those schools. Most of my IT knowledge came from gibb and Bbc.
            <br>
            <br>
            From <strong>Front-End languages</strong> like <strong>JavaScript</strong>/<strong>JQuery</strong> to <strong>Back-End languages</strong> like <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Android(Java)</strong>, <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>php</strong> but also <strong>script languages</strong> like <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>python</strong> and <strong>BASH</strong>.
            <br>
            We didn't just learn how to program we also learned how to use programs to help us like for example <strong>Github</strong>. Where we can upload our projects and download the newest version that easily.
            <br>
            As of now I am trying to learn JS Frameworks like React and Angular just by watching videos online.
