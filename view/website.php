    What's up with the color scheme you might ask?
    <br>
    It has something to do with vaporwave. This version of <span id="vppink">pink</span>, <span id="vpviol">violet</span>, <span id="vpblue">blue</span> and <span id="vpgree">green</span> is very much associated with it.
    <br>
    Now you might be asking yourself, what the hell even is vaporwave?
    <br>
    Vaporwave is a music genre I myself really like. It's very random and extra, however it is still a beautiful and good genre.
    <br>
    I don't just like Vaporwave because it sounds good, I like it because it reminds me of me. I can be really extra and random at times but even then I can function correctly.
