    What's up with the (color & background) scheme you might ask?
    <br>
    <strong>This is Vaporwave</strong>. This version of <span id="vppink">pink</span>, <span id="vpviol">violet</span>, <span id="vpblue">blue</span> and <span id="vpgree">green</span> is very much associated with it.
    <br>
    Now you might be asking yourself, what is Vaporwave?
    <br>
    Vaporwave is a music genre I really like.
    <br>
    How I think can be really <strong>extra</strong>, <strong>weird</strong> and <strong>out of the box</strong>, just like Vaporwave. A Vaporwave song is very <strong>unpredictable</strong> and never sounds the same.
    <br>
    I don't want to waste this platform just to show you what I am capable to do but also to share my story.

    <strong>Everything I do is with passion and is personal to me and I will always try my best and give it my all.</strong>
