    What's up with the (color & background) scheme, you might ask? 
    <br>
    <strong>This is Vaporwave</strong>. This <span id="vppink">col</span><span id="vpviol">or p</span><span id="vpblue">ale</span><span id="vpgree">tte</span> is very much associated with it. 
    <br>
    Now you might be asking yourself, what is Vaporwave?
    <br>
    Vaporwave is a music genre I really like.
    <br>
    How I think can be really <strong>extra</strong>, <strong>weird</strong>, and <strong>out of the box</strong>, just like Vaporwave. A Vaporwave song is very <strong>unpredictable</strong> and never sounds the same. 
    <br>
    I don't want to waste this platform just to show you what I am capable of but also to share my story.
    <br>
    <strong>Everything I do is with passion and is personal to me and I will always try my best and give it my all.</strong>
