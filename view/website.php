    What's up with the (color & background) scheme you might ask?
    <br>
    This is Vaporwave. This version of <span id="vppink">pink</span>, <span id="vpviol">violet</span>, <span id="vpblue">blue</span> and <span id="vpgree">green</span> is very much associated with it.
    <br>
    Now you might be asking yourself, what is Vaporwave?
    <br>
    Vaporwave is a music genre I really like.
    <br>
    How I think can be really <b>extra</b>, <b>weird</b> and <b>out of the box</b>, just like Vaporwave. A Vaporwave song is very <b>unpredictable</b> and never sounds like a different song.
